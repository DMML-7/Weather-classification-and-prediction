Coursework Overview
The group project at hand involves choosing one topic of application and then selecting and analyzing 1â€“3
unique datasets while dividing the project into five distinct phases. The project's overarching goal is to
explore, analyze, and apply machine learning techniques to these datasets. The project emphasizes team
work, data exploration, and the application of various machine learning methods, including clustering,
decision trees, and neural networks

###Our Project Milestones:

  Week 3: Finalize topic, finalize datasets and lay out the objectives.
  
  Week 4: Carry out data visualization on datasets. Finish PowerPoint for D1. (R1)
  
  Week 5: Change PowerPoint slides as per feedback. Start preprocessing.
  
  Week 6: Complete preprocessing. Visualize data after preprocessing and analyze. (R2)
  
  Week 7: Experiment with clustering (R3)
  
  Week 8: Start training models. Evaluate their performance. (R4)
  
  Week 9:Experiment with Neural Networks (R5)
  
  Week 10: Work on the report
  
  Week 11: Finalize report
